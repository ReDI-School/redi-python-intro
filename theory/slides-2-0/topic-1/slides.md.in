* Programming skills
  * Problem analysis
  * Problem decomposition
  * Design and implementation
  * Testing and debugging
* Python syntax
  * Essential subset of Python3 features

* Don’t worry, it’s not a theoretical computers science course
* Learning skills requires practicing
* We will have to code

# How will we learn?

* Class work: Theory + Programming tasks
  * **Please ask questions**
  * Slides and code samples are published
* Homework
  * Based on the previous class
  * Published after the lesson
  * Not mandatory but we highly recommend you to do it - programming is a skill and requires practice
* Feedback
  * **Please complain**
  * [Link to the feedback form](https://goo.gl/forms/0vzhNp7qLigY84Wq2)
* Attendance tracking
  * You have to attend at least 80% of lessons to get the confirmation letter from ReDI

# Algorithm

You have distance (S) and time (t), how to calculate the average speed?
* 1st attempt: “Divide S by t”
  * Computer doesn’t know, what S and t is
* 2nd attempt:
  * Request and remember a number for S
  * Request and remember a number for t
  * Divide S by t and remember the result
  * Print the result
* 3rd attempt: ...

# How to explain an algorithm to a computer?

* Physical hardware (CPU) has a set of commands (100-500 commands) - instruction set
  * Those commands are not really readable for a human: “move 16 bytes from address xxx to address yyy”
* Natural human language is not formal enough - hard for computer to understand (yet)

# How to explain an algorithm to a computer?

* High-level programming languages (Python, C++, Java, Javascript etc)
  * Formal
  * Can be read and written by humans
  * Can be compiled as or interpreted to instruction set

# Why Python?

* 1994: Version 1
  * Not young (But is actively developed)
  * Mature
* Goals (some of them)
  * Easy and intuitive but as powerful as those of the major competitors
  * Suitable for everyday tasks allowing for short development times
  * Open-source (free)
* Many areas of application
  * Web-development (backend)
  * Automation (e.g. automated testing)
  * Robotics (prototyping)
  * Artificial Intelligence
  * Data Science

* Python in Web:
  * Youtube
  * Dropbox
  * Google
  * Quora
  * Instagram
  * BitTorrent (Earlier Version)
  * Spotify
  * Reddit
  * Pinterest
  * BitBucket
  * EVE Online MMOPG
  * Mercurial Source Control

# Setting up Python3

**Linux**: Should be installed: open Terminal (Ctrl+Alt+T on Ubuntu) and type **python3**:
```bash
$ python3
Python 3.6.7 (default, Oct 22 2018, 11:32:17)
[GCC 8.2.0] on linux
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>>
```

**Windows & MacOSx**: If not installed (nothing with the word Python in start menu), go to https://www.python.org/downloads/ , download and install latest 3.x version
